Import comments from a Disqus export file.

== Description ==

This plugin will import comments from a Disqus export file. 

Due to a limitation with the current version of the Disqus Comments plugin the import does not retain nested commenting. Once this support is available in the XML, we will provide support.

Please provide feedback and bug reports in the [Forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/disqus-comments-importer?forum_id=10#postform)

== Installation ==

Upload the Disqus Comments Importer plugin to your blog, Activate it, then navigate to Tools -> Imports from your WordPress admin panel.
